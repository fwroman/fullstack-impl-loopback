# Fullstack Web Aplication Test

This project is a fullstack implementation to retrieve github users information from the github API to import it as needed inside a local database through a custom REST API which is consumed by a web application. The REST API have basic HTTP operations to create, retrieve, update and delete data located in the local database.

### Pre requirements üìã

First thing first, you will need to prepare your local node.js environment which will allow you to deploy both backend and frontend projects. We recommend you to have the version 8.9.x or higher for the correct functioning of the whole application.

### Instalation üîß

Once you have your local environment ready, you will need to install @loopback/cli and @angular/cli in order to start up both backend and frontend projects.

```
npm install -g @loopback/cli
```

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After you've already cloned this project, you will need to install all the server side and client side dependencies.

_Server side:_
```
cd servidor
npm install
```

_Client side:_

## Deployment üì¶

In order to start the backend server which exposes the REST API, you will have to run npm start. The server will be deployed in the port 3000 by default.

```
cd servidor
npm start
```

Regarding to the frontend client you will have to run ng serve to deploy it over the port 4200 by default.

```
cd angular
ng serve
```

You can specify a different port with the option --port
